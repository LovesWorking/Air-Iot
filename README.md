This is used for automating non-iot devices through air quality data. There is no limit to the amout devices you can connect.

This was created for the purpose of automating greenhouses, swamp-coolers or anything you need to automate through air-quality.

## Currently only supports the Awair Element for air quality and TP-Link - Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plugs

## Quickstart

First, install, build and run the Next.JS app:

```bash
npm i
# Then
npm run build
# Then
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can also open the app on your phone or any other device as long as it's on the same network. Your URL will be your modem/router ip + port 3000 ie:

```bash
 192.168.0.1:3000
```
